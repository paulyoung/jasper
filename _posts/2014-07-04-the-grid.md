I’m finally able to share that I recently joined <a href="https://thegrid.io/#14" target="_blank">The Grid</a>!

I feel proud to be a part of the team behind <a href="http://gridstylesheets.org" target="_blank">GSS</a>, <a href="http://noflojs.org" target="_blank">NoFlo</a>, <a href="https://flowhub.io" target="_blank">FlowHub</a>, and more.

<h2>Backing the Future</h2>

I first encountered The Grid last year when I backed the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment" target="_blank">NoFlo Development Environment on Kickstarter</a>, and again a few months ago after working with Auto Layout on iOS.

At that time I was frustrated with web development and had sought refuge in producing native applications. Underwhelmed by the current landscape, I wondered if I’d ever go back.

The Grid changed all of that. Here are just a few reasons why I’m excited about what we’re doing:

<h2>Remote</h2>

We’re a distributed team comprised of people across 7 countries. I love that our culture supports working remotely where geography isn’t a barrier to working with great people. Everyone I’ve come into contact with has been incredibly talented and humble.

<h2>Style & Substance</h2>

Design is given the attention it deserves. In conjunction with the innovative technology required to make them a reality, beautiful aesthetics are at the forefront of everything we do.

<h2>Open Source</h2>

Just take a look at <a href="https://github.com/noflo" target="_blank">one</a> or <a href="https://github.com/gss" target="_blank">two</a> of our organizations on GitHub and it’s easy to see that we believe in open source. I’m a big proponent for writing software in an open source environment that encourages collaboration and produces more modular, testable code with better documentation.
<h2>A Digital Frontier</h2>

Years of development have been invested into projects like these to facilitate building our platform, which launches soon.

I’m continually blown away by what we’re doing and I can’t wait for everyone else to experience it too.
